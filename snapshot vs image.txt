Ami- -  1)An AMI image is a backup of an entire EC2 instance.
   Associated with an AMI image are EBS snapshots. 
  Those EBS snapshots are the backups of the individual 
  EBS volumes attached to the EC2 instance at the time 
  the AMI image was created.

  2)If your restore objective is to create a fresh EC2 
  instance quickly to replace a failed EC2 instance, then 
  creating AMI images is definitely the way to go

Snapshot -1) An EBS snapshot is a backup of a single EBS volume. 
  The EBS snapshot contains all the data stored on the 
  EBS volume at the time the EBS snapshot was created.
  
  2)Since EBS snapshots can be thought of as incremental, 
  you only pay for the storage of the changed data.

The process of creating an AMI image will also create EBS snapshots.
 So even if you need to restore a single EBS volume, you can do so from the individual EBS snapshot.
